# Lab 6 (Final Project)
## TODO 
- Finish / Fix inverse kinematics
 - make inverse kinematics script callable from C++ (compile?)
- Finish Lab 5 / tf_broadcaster / leapmotion control
- OpenCV Camera Calibration (If it doesn't take too much time)
- Image processing -> is it robust enough? probably not.
